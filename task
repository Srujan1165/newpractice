1.basic Git Operations

- Initialize a Git repository and add a file with your name and a fun fact. Stage and commit changes.  
- Add another file listing your tasks and commit the changes.  
- Use `git status` to review the current repository state.

2: Branching and Merging

- Create a new branch for adding more information to your file.  
- Commit changes in the new branch, then merge it into the `main` branch.  
- Push the changes to GitHub.

3: Forking and Pull Requests

- Fork a public GitHub repository, then clone it to your machine.  
- Create a feature branch in the forked repo, make changes, and commit them.  
- Push the feature branch to GitHub and create a pull request to merge it into the original repository.

4: Collaboration and Merge Conflicts

- Collaborate with a peer by editing the same file in separate branches.  
- Resolve any merge conflicts that arise, then push and merge the changes.  
- Delete branches after merging to keep the repository clean.
